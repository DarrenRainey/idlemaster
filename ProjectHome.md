IdleMaster is an Idling game for IRC. It doesn't follow the typical IdleRPG rules found at http://idlerpg.net, however. It is a custom breed of rules and settings for the optimal amusement factor and long-term enjoyment of the players involved. It can be run from one place and connect to multiple IRC servers using a simple command, so the game played can be cross-server.

It also has the ability to connect to a website (currently mine) and update data there, to be displayed live (along with showing some statistics that aren't actually available in the game).
